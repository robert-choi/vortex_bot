## PV Legendary Shiny Hunter
---
### Introduction
This tool is a basic selenium bot which allows users to selectively hunt for 
certain (rare) pokemon and pokemon variants. As you probably know, bot usage 
is BANNED on PV, so use at your own risk!

### How to use
To use the bot, simply enter the desired map and login info into the 
hunting_info.py file. Then, run the bot from a new terminal window. Updates 
will be printed here, so keep an eye out for changes on the console. PV's 
activity timer runs on a ~3 hr cycle, so make sure to battle and pause 
intermittently. (I was banned a day in and can't be bothered to re-battle 
all the gyms so rip that)
